<h1> Situationist International </h1>

Post-marxism --> Heavily influenced by Marx, i.e., philosophers have only interpreted the world, the point now is to change it.

"The owl of Minerva spreads its wings only with the falling of the dusk" (Hegel) --> "the greatness of art only emerges at the dusk of life" (Debord)

Rethinking involves what is one's place, what is a model to follow. Debord's theory of the de rÃªve: people drop their relations / work / leisure / and all their other usual motives for movement in action and let themselves
be drawn by the attractions of the terrain and random / situational encounters.

Psychogeography = study of the laws and precise effects of the geographical environment (whether consciously organized or not) on emotions and behaviours
of individuals. 

Wandering as standing still: Debord's mapping involved imaginary connections, i.e., a route built not on chance but on feelings, values, and ideologies.

Marxist critique of work, i.e., the sort of labour creating:
- sensous work (involves abstract labour--which creates value based on time) vs
- capitalist work (which creates...stuff)

Marx wanted to compensate workers directly for their time as opposed to using commodity money as wage to purchase their labour power, i.e., treating the work of people as
commodity itself. It's not about increasing production / productivity, if creative capacities of people are increased...they can become free?

Treadmill dynamic under capitalism: increased production (with the idea of increased amount of time spent working) --> increased abundance / accumulation of wealth --> increased poverty

Task for a socialist: to create a society where labour time no longer determines our social life / production / distribution

To read Debord:
- locate a clause (subject-verb-object)
- chop it up
- spell it out in your own words
- think it over
- wash, rinse, repeat
