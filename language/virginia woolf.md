# *On Craftsmanship* by Virginia Woolf

##### `1937` - `BBC Radio Broadcast` - `Words`

### The impossibility of words being 'words' (i.e. "living in dictionaries"). </br> Words don't live in dictionaries, they live in the mind.

Woolf is trying to take down (subversively) the "voice of Britain" (i.e. BBC) while being on the station. Radio technology and its sedimentation functioning similar to the dictionary?

> Of course, you can catch them and sort them and place them in alphabetical order in dictionaries. But words do not live in dictionaries; they live in the mind. If you want proof of this, consider how often in moments of emotion when we most need words we find none. Yet there is the dictionary; there at our disposal are some half-a-million words all in alphabetical order. But can we use them? No, because words do not live in dictionaries, they live in the mind. Look again at the dictionary. There beyond a doubt lie plays more splendid than Antony and Cleopatra; poems more lovely than the Ode to A Nightingale; novels beside which Pride and Prejudice or David Copperfield are the crude bunglings of amateurs. It is only a question of finding the right words and putting them in the right order. But we cannot do it because they do not live in dictionaries; they live in the mind. And how do they live in the mind? Variously and strangely, much as human beings live, by ranging hither and thither, by falling in love, and mating together. It is true that they are much less bound by ceremony and convention than we are.

### Survival, beauty, and truth:

> How can we combine the old words in new orders so that they survive, so that they create beauty, so that they tell the truth? That is the question.
And the person who could answer that question would deserve whatever crown of glory the world has to offer. Think what it would mean if you could teach, if you could learn, the art of writing. Why, every book, every newspaper would tell the truth, would create beauty.

> Perhaps that is their (words) most striking peculiarity — their need of change. It is because the truth they try to catch is many-sided, and they convey it by being themselves many-sided, flashing this way, then that. Thus they mean one thing to one person, another thing to another person; they are unintelligible to one generation, plain as a pikestaff to the next. And it is because of this complexity that they survive. Perhaps then one reason why we have no great poet, novelist or critic writing to-day is that we refuse words their liberty. We pin them down to one meaning, their useful meaning, the meaning which makes us catch the train, the meaning which makes us pass the examination. And when words are pinned down they fold their wings and die. Finally, and most emphatically, words, like ourselves, in order to live at their ease, need privacy. Undoubtedly they like us to think, and they like us to feel, before we use them; but they also like us to pause; to become unconscious. Our unconsciousness is their privacy; our darkness is their light. . . . That pause was made, that veil of darkness was dropped, to tempt words to come together in one of those swift marriages which are perfect images and create everlasting beauty.

Woolf argues that human character changed in 1910 as a larger infrastructure (social forces, politics, culture, and technological milieux) changed. This was also when the radio was introduced into most English homes i.e. whose voice was always being on / being heard? (and new ways of expressing / communicating through verbal tone)

# *Mr. Bennett and Mrs. Brown* by Virginia Woolf

##### `1923` - `Essay` - `Creating a Literary Space` 

How can radio tone / humour / irony be related to characterization?

If we think of modernism as a "disquieting juxtaposition" where collisions from voice (sonically), irony, humour, and tone, somewhat complement the characterization?

Woolf is also creating / defining her own literary space within modernism?

Artistic experimentation has been a tool to navigate personal / individual crisis (of modernity and the self), and loss (of identity and community) but there are different ways within this "experimentation" that is not just Joycean / Pound / Eliot.
She critiques some of their work while also respecting their skill and ambition. She viewes artistic experimentation in literary modernism as a sincere / geniune attempt to kind of get at the truth (and she is quite focused on the concepts of truth and beauty). This work highlights a sense of urgency and sincereity of the modernist experimental undertaking.

> For these reasons, then, we must reconcile ourselves to a season of failures and fragments. We must reflect that where so much strength is spent on finding a way of telling the truth, the truth itself is bound to reach us in rather an exhausted and chaotic condition. Ulysses, Queen Victoria, Mr. Prufrock—to give Mrs. Brown some of the names she has made famous lately—is a little pale and dishevelled by the time her rescuers reach her.

**Ephemerality of the medium** (e.g. radio) brings up the question of how long is something being held / sent / received. </br> How to have access to it afterwards? I guess **choice of / access to a medium** became a huge / intentional aspect of "literary" experimentation technique?

 The piece also brings up the issue of formal experimentation in the arts--how it draws on / mobilizes different media possibilites available in a given moment. How artists work within and even reference technological and media ecologies also ties into this experimentation.
